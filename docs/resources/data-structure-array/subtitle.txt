We already introduced one basic data structure
last episode: Arrays, also called lists or
vectors in some languages.

These are a series of values stored in memory.

So instead of just a single value being saved
into a variable, like j=5, we can define a whole series
of numbers, and save that into an array variable.

To be able to find a particular value in this
array, we have to specify an index.

Almost all programing languages start arrays
at index 0, and use a square bracket syntax to
denote array access.

It’s easy to confuse the fifth number in
the array with the number at index 5.

They are not the same.

Remember, the number at index 5 is the 6th
number in the array because the first number
is at index 0.

Arrays are extremely versatile data structures,
used all the time, and so there are many functions
that can handle them to do useful things.

For example, pretty much every programming
language comes with a built-in sort function,
where you just pass in your array, and it
comes back sorted.

So there’s no need to write that algorithm
from scratch.

Very closely related are Strings, which are
just arrays of characters, like letters, numbers,
punctuation and other written symbols.
