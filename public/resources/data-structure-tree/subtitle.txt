"If we update our node struct to contain not just one, but two pointers, we can build trees, another data structure that’s used in many algorithms."

"The top most node is called the root."

"And any nodes that hang from other nodes are called children nodes."

"As you might expect, nodes above children are called parent nodes."

"And finally, any nodes that have no children -- where the tree ends -- are called Leaf Nodes."

"In our example, nodes can have up to two children, and for that reason, this particular data structure is called a binary tree."

"But you could just as easily have trees with three, four or any number of children by modifying the data structure accordingly."

"You can even have tree nodes that use linked lists to store all the nodes they point to."

"An important property of trees – both in real life and in data structures – is that there’s a one-way path from roots to leaves."

"It’d be weird if roots connected to leaves,that connected to roots."
